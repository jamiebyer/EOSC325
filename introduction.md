Explore **unconfined** flow between two points (or water bodies) each with known hydraulic head for differente aquifer materials. 
See "Sources" below for the origin and inspiration of this app.

* Set "measured" hydraulic head at left and right sides of the 2D section with sliders h1 and h2 respectively.
* Set hydraulic conductivity to a value within bounds determined by choice of material. 
* Set recharge up to 10cm per day. Negative 'recharge' represents evaporation/transpiration. 

Note: Flow arrows not to scale.
