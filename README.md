# Hydrogeology Demos
Creating demos for the hydrogeology course, EOSC325, using Plotly Dash. This dashboard is hosted [here](https://hydro-unconfined-flow.herokuapp.com/).

## Unconfined Flow with Recharge
This demo is based on the supplemental file for the book "Hydrogeological Properties of Earth Materials and Principles of Groundwater Flow", by the Groundwater Project.

The first plot plots hydraulic head. It shows the location of the groundwater divide. The plot has qualitative arrows indicating the direction and magnitude of flow.

The second plot plots q'_x, the flow per unit width. The groundwater divide occurs where q'_x=0.
